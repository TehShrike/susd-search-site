# To run/develop locally

[Node](https://nodejs.org/) 6 required.

1. `git clone https://github.com/TehShrike/susd-search-site.git`
2. `cd susd-search-site`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm run startdev`

That's all you should need to do to run it locally.  If that doesn't work for you, open an issue to let me know.

To develop the client side app, run `npm run watch` in another terminal window to have a process automatically watch for changes and rebuild the client app when necessary.
