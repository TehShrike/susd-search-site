		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			I love tabletop games, and I love <a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/">Shut Up & Sit Down</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides watching all their new reviews, I watch episodes from their backlog and browse through their old videos.
		</p>
		<p>
			The search on shutupandsitdown.com has a few niggling issues that kept bothering me:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It's slow</li>
			<li>The images are large and take a lot of bandwidth if you're mobile</li>
			<li>Browser navigation doesn't work (back/forward) and you can't send anyone a direct link to "all reviews" or "all episodes of The Opener"</li>
			<li>There's no way to search through just the videos without searching the list of games or written reviews</li>
			<li>There's no way to search by more than one tag, or by tags + "just videos", or tags + search term</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			So I made this site.
